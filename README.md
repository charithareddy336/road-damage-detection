# Road Damage Detector

## Overview
This project is a computer vision implementation developed to understand object detection techniques using deep learning. The goal of the project is to detect road damages from images using a trained model.

This implementation was carried out as part of my learning in computer vision and deep learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of road images containing various types of damages such as cracks and potholes. The dataset was used for training and evaluating the detection model.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and resizing
- Model training using a deep learning-based object detection approach
- Model evaluation on test images
- Visualization of predicted bounding boxes

## Results
The trained model was able to detect road damage regions in images with reasonable accuracy. The project helped in understanding object detection workflows, training pipelines, and performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (whichever you used)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
